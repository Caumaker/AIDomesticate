# AIDomesticate (AID)

AIDomesticate (AID) is a modular and extensible framework designed to simplify the creation and management of AI agents using LangChain and LLMs. The framework is built to support various maturity phases of AI agent development, ensuring a gradual and controlled transition from human-in-the-loop systems to fully autonomous operations.

## Key Features

    •	Modular Design: Easily create, extend, and integrate different AI agents, including Planners, Makers, and Supervisors.
    •	Maturity Phases: Implement systems with distinct phases of maturity:
    •	Phase 1: Human debugging for refining agent interactions.
    •	Phase 2: Supervisor-led iteration with human approval for critical steps.
    •	Phase 3: Full autonomy with minimal human intervention.
    •	Specialist Supervisors: Utilize specialized supervisors for planning and execution tasks, enhanced by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for better context and accuracy.
    •	Open Source: Licensed under the MIT License, encouraging collaborative development and contribution from the community.
